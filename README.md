# InnoSensors Civic Hackathon 2020 Submission

This repository containst the code of team InnoSensors submission in in the Civic Hackathon Pakistan 2020. To reiterate, the problem statement and the solution is as follows.

## Problem
Crop health monitoring is plagued with dearth of data, a situation made worse by barriers of relevant institutions limiting accessibility, not only leading to inaccuracies in analysis, research, predictions but also reducing the timeliness of data.

## Solution
In order to increase the data pool, we propose an in house IoT solution created using off the shelf sensors. This hardware would provide data on intervals that can be decided by the user. Furthermore, as the components are low cost and small in size, the solution is economically feasible to be implemented in fields. Thus, we will be creating IoT devices to monitor the real time levels of gases in the atmosphere, air temperature, humidity levels as well as the soil temperature and moisture. These will then be deployed in test fields and the data will be transferred on defined intervals to a web portal, accessible from anywhere at any time. An IoT based solution can provide critical information in a timely and mobile manner as well as improve independence from third party data sources when our devices would be utilized.
